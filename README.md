** HOW TO RUN **

$ nodemon server


** THE CAR GAME **

The car game is located inside the bilspill/ directory.

So the url would be

http://localhost:3000/bilspill/display.html (display of the game)
http://localhost:3000/bilspill/control.html (the touch controller)

The game is played by using the keyboard with ← ↑ →. I need ← ↑ → to be toucheble buttons in the control.html

I assume the info need to transfere between display.html and control.html with websockets. But whatever works.

I have already installed and are using websockets in the game and the main application which is the timeline.
